# 🤖 AI Test  

## 🏆 Overview  
This project was developed as a final assignment. The goal was to create an **AI-driven battle simulation** featuring two opposing factions, each with a **player-controlled leader** and multiple **NPC units**.  

#### 🎯 Key Objectives  
- **Theta\* Pathfinding** – Optimized pathfinding with direct visibility checks.  
- **Flocking Behavior** – NPCs follow their leader using Arrive + Separation. 
- **Finite State Machines** – AI for leaders & NPCs (combat, survival, etc.).  
- **Line of Sight & Field of View** – Enemy detection & attack conditions.  
- **Obstacle Avoidance** – Intelligent navigation around small obstacles.

## 🚀 Features  
🔹 **Theta\*** – A more efficient alternative to A\*.  
🔹 **Flocking System** – Boids-like behavior for group movement.  
🔹 **Finite State Machines** – A scalable approach to AI behaviors.
